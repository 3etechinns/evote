{{=T('This is an electornic system for online verifiable voting. You can login and create a ballot using a Word-like interface and register list of voters. We email each voter a unique link to vote. We count the votes and issue results. Upon voting each voter is issued a receipt by email. The receipt contains an anonymized copy of the ballot. The anonymized copies of the ballots are also sent to the administrator and published. This allows each user, at any time, to check that their vote has been counted. The ballots are digitally signed to make sure they have not been tampered with. Each ballot has a unique ID the ballot IDs are published to prevent counterfit ballots.')}}
